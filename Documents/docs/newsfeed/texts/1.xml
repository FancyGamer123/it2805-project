	<title>Suggesting Some Fixed Dialogue for Gears of War 4</title>
	<p>I may have given the impression, in my review of Gears of War 4, that I picked up on a degree of repetition in the dialogue. And not just in the mid-combat quips, which are inevitably going to repeat themselves in organic gameplay because there are only so many ways a burly man can crow about grubs and the scratching thereof; the conversations designed to move what passes for the plot tend to be rather samey as well.

	This is probably an inevitable result of the campaign consisting largely of identikit arena shootouts, and there not being much new to say about each one. But that's giving up too easily. It's just a matter of more creativity. I'd like to take a moment now to identify five of the most unbearably overused lines, analyse their usage, and propose a few alternatives.</p>
