	<title>The PS1 Era</title>
	<p>Whoops, been a while since the last column, hasn't it; I've been rather occupied with moving from one sovereign nation to a different sovereign nation, but you may have noticed this column stopped being weekly quite some time ago, and that's mainly because frankly I can't always think of anything to talk about. Oh, how I miss the days when there were enough hours in the week to reliably type up some thoughts, and that rather underhandedly gets us onto the topic of nostalgia.

	Nostalgia has always been an interesting phenomenon, partly because there's something predictable about it. I'm talking about something I've referenced before: the twenty-to-twenty-five year rule. Modern culture is always nostalgic for the period approximately twenty to twenty-five years prior to the present day. Because the most influential creators of culture are usually in their 30s, and most people are nostalgic for the things they had and experienced around the age of 12, emotionally mature enough to appreciate things and gain a sense of personal identity from those things, but not old enough to be cynical or embarrassed about it.</p>
