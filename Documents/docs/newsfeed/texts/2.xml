	<title>This is How You Fix RPG Sidequests</title>
	<p>For no particular reason I'd like to bring up the concept of sidequests. The essential component of an open world RPG, for without them it would not be an open world RPG at all; it would just be a plain old standard RPG with lots of trudging about unnecessary scenery.
	
	But as essential as they are, sidequests are so often a source of annoyance. The classic example is the inevitable quest to clear giant rats out of Farmer Joe Dickcheese's basement that the Elder Scrolls games eventually started making ironic self-aware jokes about (although not to the extent that they stopped including the fucking things). Maybe that sort of quest is fine for a starting adventurer one step up from a village handyman, but not for the glittering world-saving hero with access to the ear of a king and the vagina of every eligible princess, warrior maiden and sexy witch in the land.</p>
